OpenClaw Gateway - Device Pairing Solution
==========================================

KEY CHANGES:
-----------
1. Gateway auto-generates secure token and displays it in logs
2. Device management API added for web-based pairing
3. **CRITICAL: Gateway now auto-configures to bypass device pairing**


DEVICE PAIRING SOLUTION:
------------------------
The container automatically configures the gateway to bypass device pairing by
setting `gateway.controlUi.allowInsecureAuth=true` during startup.

**Why this works:**
- OpenClaw's Control UI normally requires device pairing for security
- Setting `allowInsecureAuth=true` bypasses the pairing requirement
- Gateway auth is still enforced via bearer token (secure)
- This matches the approach used by other Railway templates

**What happens on startup:**
1. Container runs: `openclaw config set gateway.controlUi.allowInsecureAuth true`
2. Container runs: `openclaw config set gateway.trustedProxies ["127.0.0.1"]`
3. Gateway starts with token auth enabled
4. Users can connect immediately without device pairing

**Fallback Device Management API:**
If pairing is still needed for specific channels (Telegram/Discord):
  GET  /api/devices          → List all devices (pending and approved)
  POST /api/devices/approve  → Approve a device by requestId

Launcher UI shows "🔐 Pair Device" button for Telegram/Discord channel pairing.


AUTHENTICATION:
--------------
1. Gateway REQUIRES authentication (cannot run without it)

2. Auto-generated token printed to logs:
   → Token generated using openssl rand -hex 32 (64 characters)
   → Displayed in Railway logs during startup
   → Look for: "🔑 Copy this token to connect to your gateway:"
   → Token changes on each restart (unless OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN is set)

3. Persistent token option:
   → Set OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN env var for static token
   → Recommended for production deployments
   → Persists across container restarts


HOW TO CONNECT:
---------------
1. Deploy the app to Railway
2. Check Railway logs for startup output
3. Find the line: "🔑 Copy this token to connect to your gateway:"
4. Copy the token from the next line
5. Use token when connecting to the gateway

For launcher deployments:
  → Token is passed automatically via OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN
  → Stored securely in deployment database
  → Available in launcher UI with copy button


FOR PERSISTENT TOKEN:
--------------------
Set environment variable before deploy:
  OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=<your-secure-token>

Generate secure token:
  openssl rand -hex 32


SECURITY:
--------
✓ Token NOT exposed via public web endpoints
✓ Only visible in deployment logs (secure)
✓ Launcher stores tokens securely in database
✓ Each deployment gets unique token


BEHAVIOR:
--------
✓ Gateway starts with auth enabled
✓ Token auto-generated if not provided
✓ Token printed clearly in logs
✓ Secure: no public endpoint exposure
✓ Clients connect using the token from logs or launcher UI
