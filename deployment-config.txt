OpenClaw Agent - Required Deployment Update
============================================

ACTION REQUIRED:
---------------
Redeploy the Railway service to apply authentication fix.


WHAT WAS FIXED:
--------------
✓ Removed invalid --no-auth flag (was causing gateway crash)
✓ Implemented proper authentication handling
✓ Gateway now starts successfully with or without auth


DEPLOYMENT STEPS:
-----------------

1. GO TO RAILWAY DASHBOARD
   → Select your openclaw-agent deployment

2. TRIGGER NEW DEPLOYMENT
   → Push this update to main branch (will auto-deploy)
   OR
   → Manually trigger redeploy in Railway dashboard

3. VERIFY ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
   Required:
   ✓ OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

   Optional (no changes needed unless you want auth):
   - OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=<token>  (for secured access)
   - OPENCLAW_PASSWORD=<password>    (alternative auth)
   - OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini        (cost optimization)

4. MONITOR DEPLOYMENT
   → Check logs for "✓ Gateway process started"
   → Verify /health endpoint returns 200 OK
   → Test WebSocket connection


EXPECTED RESULT:
----------------
Gateway starts without authentication errors.
No "disconnected (1008): unauthorized" errors.
WebSocket connections work immediately.


IF STILL SEEING ERRORS:
-----------------------
- Wait 30 seconds for gateway initialization
- Check Railway logs for detailed error messages  
- Verify OPENAI_API_KEY is set correctly
- Ensure you're using the latest deployment (not cached build)
