OpenClaw Agent - Authentication Update
=======================================

ISSUE FIXED:
-----------
Error: "disconnected (1008): unauthorized"
This gateway requires auth. Add a token or password, then click Connect.

The OpenClaw gateway was starting without authentication configured, causing
connection failures.


WHAT CHANGED:
------------
Updated start.sh to automatically handle authentication based on environment
variables. The gateway now supports three authentication modes:

1. No Authentication (--no-auth flag)
2. Token Authentication  
3. Password Authentication


HOW TO FIX:
----------
Add ONE of these environment variables to your deployment:

  OPENCLAW_NO_AUTH=1
    → Disables authentication (use for testing/internal deployments)

  OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=your-secret-token
    → Token-based authentication (recommended for production)

  OPENCLAW_PASSWORD=your-password
    → Password authentication

If no authentication variable is set, the container will default to --no-auth.


FILES MODIFIED:
--------------
- start.sh: Added authentication logic to gateway startup
- README.md: Added authentication documentation and troubleshooting


DEPLOYMENT ACTION REQUIRED:
--------------------------
Add authentication environment variable → Redeploy service
