OpenClaw Agent - Required Deployment Update
============================================

ACTION REQUIRED:
---------------
Redeploy the Railway service to apply authentication fix.


WHAT WAS FIXED:
--------------
✓ Gateway now properly handles authentication (which IS required)
✓ Auto-generates temporary token if none provided
✓ Gateway starts successfully with authentication


AUTHENTICATION REQUIRED:
-----------------------
OpenClaw gateway REQUIRES authentication. Choose one:

  OPTION 1 - Set persistent token (RECOMMENDED):
  OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=your-secret-token
    → Generate with: openssl rand -hex 32
    → Token persists across restarts
    → Best for production use

  OPTION 2 - Set password:
  OPENCLAW_PASSWORD=your-password
    → Simple password authentication

  OPTION 3 - Use auto-generated token (DEFAULT):
    → Don't set any auth variables
    → Container generates temporary token on startup
    → Token shown in Railway logs
    → Changes on each restart


DEPLOYMENT STEPS:
-----------------

1. GO TO RAILWAY DASHBOARD
   → Select your openclaw-agent deployment

2. SET ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
   Required:
   ✓ OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

   Recommended (for persistent access):
   ✓ OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=<generated-token>

3. TRIGGER NEW DEPLOYMENT
   → Push update to main branch (auto-deploys)
   OR
   → Manually trigger redeploy

4. GET YOUR TOKEN
   → Check Railway deployment logs
   → Look for: "🔑 Copy this token to connect to your gateway:"
   → Copy the 64-character token from logs
   → If using launcher: token shown in UI with copy button


EXPECTED RESULT:
----------------
✓ Gateway starts with authentication enabled
✓ Token printed clearly in startup logs
✓ Secure: token NOT exposed via public endpoints
✓ Clients can connect using the token from logs
✓ No more "unauthorized" errors when using correct token

ENDPOINTS:
----------
  /health  → Health check (no sensitive data)
